# Machine Vision Coursework - CE6021

## Introduction

This repository is my personal storage for the Machine Vision coursework related to the CE6021 course. It contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks where I've worked on various lab exercises, each focused on different aspects and techniques within the field of machine vision.

## Lab Index

- **Lab 1**: `convolution` - A dive into the application of convolution operations on images.
- **Lab 2**: `separable_convolution` - Understanding the efficiency of separable convolution in image filtering.
- **Lab 3**: `Canny_Hough_Algorithm` - Edge detection with the Canny algorithm and feature extraction using the Hough transform.
- **Lab 4**: `harris_corner` - Identifying corners and intersections in images using the Harris Corner Detector.
- **Lab 5**: `scale_invariant_detection` - Exploring feature detection that remains consistent across various image scales.
- **Lab 6**: `template_matching` - The basics of template matching for finding objects in an image.
- **Lab 7**: `ships_satellite` - Techniques for detecting ships in satellite imagery.
- **Lab 8**: `eigenfaces` - Face recognition utilizing the Eigenface method.
- **Lab 9**: `BoF` - Implementing the Bag of Features model for image classification.

## Personal Reflections

In each lab folder, I've included my notes and reflections on the exercises, detailing challenges I faced and insights I gained throughout the course.
